### `continuous-student-testing-server`

A group project to aggregate student test results in real time. Server side, based on Express and Sequelize.

This app shows student progress in data transformation exercises in real time. It compiles the latest submission by each student for each question she/he attempted using Jest tests in their local computers. Test results are sent to a database by a server. This is the back end, where the routes are set to read/write from/to the database.

### `installation`
